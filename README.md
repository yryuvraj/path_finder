# path_finder
The Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization project is a Python-based application designed to visually represent different pathfinding algorithms using the Pygame library.
 The primary objective is to provide a visual tool for understanding and comparing the behavior of various pathfinding algorithms, including A*, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Brute Force. The application allows users to interactively create barriers, select start and end points, and observe the pathfinding process in real-time.
 
 The project consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) that lets users interact with a grid-based environment. The key functionalities are:

Grid Generation: The application generates a square grid of variable size. Each grid cell, called a "spot," can represent a start point, end point, barrier, or pathway.
User Interaction: Users can select the start and end points on the grid, create barriers, and choose which algorithm to use for pathfinding.
Algorithm Visualization: The application visually demonstrates the pathfinding process for each algorithm, highlighting the open and closed nodes, the final path, and the obstacles.
